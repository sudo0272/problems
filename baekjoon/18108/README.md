Thailand uses Buddhist Calendar which uses the year of Sakyamuni's nirvana as standard of calendar since Thailand is a Buddhist country. However, South Korea uses Gregorian Calendar. Write a program that converts given Buddhist year to Gregorian year.

### Input
Buddhist year y is given. (1000 ≤ y ≤ 3000)

## Solution
The difference between Buddhist year and Gregorian year is 543. Thus printing y - 543 is the answer.
